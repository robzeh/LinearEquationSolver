# LinearEquationSolver
Program that solves a system of equations using Gaussian Elimination

After taking Linear Algebra and Software Development, I used this project as an opportunity to practice TDD methodologies as 
well as basic operations in Linear Algebra. 

Currently, program is only able to perform Gaussian elimination on square matrices.
